## Installation

Add the following to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install` to install via [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/omise):

```ruby
gem 'omise'
```

Or use the cutting-edge version by installing via GitHub:

```ruby
gem 'omise', github: 'omise/omise-ruby'
```

## Requirements

Tested on Ruby 2.5 and above

## Configuration

First configure your secret key:

```ruby
require "omise"

Omise.api_key = "skey_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

After you have implemented [Omise.js](https://www.omise.co/omise-js) on your frontend you can charge the card by passing the token generated by Omise.js into the `card` attribute.

```ruby
# Charge 1000.00 THB
charge = Omise::Charge.create({
  amount: 1_000_00,
  currency: "thb",
  card: params[:omise_token]
})

if charge.paid
  # handle success
  puts "thanks"
else
  # handle failure
  raise charge.failure_code
end
```

You can check the complete documentation at [omise.co/docs](https://omise.co/docs).

### API version

In case you want to enforce API version the application use, you can specify it
by setting the `api_version`. The version specified by this settings will override
the version setting in your account. This is useful if you have multiple
environments with different API versions (e.g. development on the latest but
production on the older version).

```ruby
Omise.api_version = "2019-05-29"
```

It is highly recommended to set this version to the current version you're using.

### Logging

To enable logging you can set `Omise.logger` with a Ruby logger. All HTTP requests and responses will be logged.

To disable logging, just configure `Omise.logger` to `nil`. Default is disabled.

An example configuring Rails logger:

```ruby
Omise.logger = Rails.logger
```

## Development

The test suite can be run with `bundle exec rake test`.
